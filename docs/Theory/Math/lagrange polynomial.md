# Lagrange Polynomial

Polynomial interpolation is the interpolation of a given data set by the polynomial of lowest possible degree that passes through the points of the dataset.
Lagrange interpolating polynomial is the unique polynomial of lowest degree that interpolates a given set of data.

## Definition

The Lagrange interpolating polynomial for nodes {y0, y1, ..., yk} is:

L(x) = 

lj(x) = 

As mentioned above the interpolating polynomial is unique. This characteristic allow uses in cryptography such as: Shamir's secret sharing scheme and KZC polynomial commitmens (Kate commitment)

## Uses

### Vector commitment and Verkle Tries

KZG commitments
Petersen vector commitment
